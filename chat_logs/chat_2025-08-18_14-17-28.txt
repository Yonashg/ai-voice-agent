A permit is required for most electrical work to ensure compliance with local building codes and safety regulations. This service includes
handling the full permitting process—preparing documentation, submitting applications, scheduling inspections, and making myself available to
meet the inspector if required. The fee also covers time spent coordinating with local authorities and ensuring all documentation is accurate and
submitted on time. In Washington, DC, inspections are typically scheduled through the DCRA system. While I coordinate the process and
monitor the permit status, I do not control the city inspector’s schedule. Note: Any re-inspection fees, unexpected changes to permit scope, or
additional ﬁlings requested by the jurisdiction are the responsibility of the customer. CONTACT US
